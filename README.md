Tools to speed up research in machine learning

This is a collection of tools that I use when I am doing research in machine learning.
They include scripts that help me work on clusters, plotting, analysis and aggregating
data from multiple runs of the same experiment.

Created by [Zafarali Ahmed](http://www.zafarali.me). I currently do not intend for this tool to be used widely, so expect things to break occasionally while I actively add new things.


## Clusters

- `mlresearchkit.computecanada.slurm` contains some helper scripts for you to create submissions on SLURM in particular CEDAR and GRAHAM on Compute Canada clusters.

## Command-line tools

- `cluster-submit` WIP
